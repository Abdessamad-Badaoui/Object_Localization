# Object Localization 

Object localization is a task in computer vision that focuses on pinpointing the location of objects in an image. It aims to find the exact coordinates of the object, typically represented by a bounding box around it. This process is an essential component of more advanced tasks like object detection, where the model not only recognizes the object but also specifies its precise position within the image.
