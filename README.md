# Object Localization Project

This project focuses on object localization, which is a computer vision task that involves identifying the location of objects within an image. The goal is to determine the precise coordinates of the object, usually by drawing a bounding box around it. Object localization is an essential step in more complex tasks like object detection.

## Model

For this project, we will be using the **pretrained EfficientNet_b0** model to perform object localization. EfficientNet is a powerful deep learning model known for its efficiency and high performance on image recognition tasks. 

### Fine-tuning

We will fine-tune the pretrained **EfficientNet_b0** model on our custom dataset. Fine-tuning involves adapting a pretrained model to a new task by training it on a specific dataset, allowing us to leverage the model's knowledge while adjusting it to the nuances of our data. This will help improve the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance for our object localization task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task contains images of various vegetables, each annotated with bounding boxes to indicate object locations. We will split the dataset into training and validation sets to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing the dataset, including resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and creating bounding box annotations.
2. **Model Setup**: Loading the pretrained EfficientNet_b0 model and preparing it for fine-tuning.
3. **Training**: Fine-tuning the model using our dataset, adjusting parameters to optimize localization accuracy.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and precision.
